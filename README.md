# Power-BI-Project
The project focuses on constructing a Microsoft Power BI dashboard for the Dubai Chamber of Commerce, providing a detailed analysis of financial metrics like assets, liabilities, profit and loss, revenue, and expenditure. Utilizing dummy data for confidentiality, the dashboard will offer an interactive and visually appealing presentation of the company's financial trends over the past 10 years. This tool aims to empower stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce's financial performance, aiding strategic decision-making.
